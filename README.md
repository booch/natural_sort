natural_sort
============

Python module for sorting lists naturally (i.e. 1.10 comes after 1.2).

This can be used to sort IP addresses, version numbers, variable-length alphanumeric product numbers, etc.
The lists to be sorted can contain strings, dictionaries, or objects.
For dictionaries and objects, the fields to sort on can be specified.

There's a good write-up on natural sorting at [http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/12/sorting-for-humans-natural-sort-order.html].
